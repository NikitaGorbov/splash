# SPLASH
#### Super Powerful Lightweight Advanced SHell
A command-line shell for Linux made as part of my university studies.
## Features:
- Executing programs with or without arguments

## Installation:
Requires `make`.
It is possible to compile with `GCC` or `Clang`.

- GCC is used by default. Run:
```sh
make
```

- To compile with Clang instead run:
```sh
make clang
```
After compiling you can simply run the created executable `splash`
